## Welcome to Nebula, the universal sensor driver

Nebula is a sensor driver platform that is designed to provide a unified framework for as wide a variety of devices as possible.
While it primarily targets Ethernet-based LiDAR sensors, it aims to be easily extendable to support new sensors and interfaces.
Nebula works with ROS 2 and is the recommended sensor driver for the [Autoware](https://autoware.org/) project.

## Documentation

We recommend you get started with the [Nebula Documention](https://tier4.github.io/nebula/).
Here you will find information about the background of the project, how to install and use with ROS 2, and also how to add new sensors to the Nebula driver.

To build and serve the documentation locally, see the build steps further below.

## Quick start

Nebula builds with ROS 2 Galactic and Humble.

> **Note**
>
> Boost version 1.74.0 or later is required. A manual install may be required in Ubuntu versions earlier than 22.04.

To build Nebula run the following commands in your workspace:

```bash
# In workspace
git clone https://github.com/tier4/nebula.git
cd nebula
# Import dependencies
vcs import < build_depends.repos
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -y -r
# Build Nebula
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

To build with support for [Agnocast](https://github.com/tier4/agnocast), TIER IV's zero-copy
middleware, refer to the Agnocast section below.

_(optional)_ To build and serve the documentation locally (including API reference), run:

```shell
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install doxygen

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Generate API reference from C++ sources
mkdocs build --config-file scripts/mkdoxy_gen.yml

# Preprocess docs (expands macros, merges API reference)
python3 scripts/preprocess_zensical_docs.py

# Serve locally at http://localhost:8000
zensical serve --config-file .zensical.toml
```

To launch Nebula as a ROS 2 node with default parameters for your sensor model:

```bash
ros2 launch nebula nebula_launch.py sensor_model:=*sensor_model_name*
```

For example, for a Hesai Pandar40P sensor:

```bash
ros2 launch nebula nebula_launch.py sensor_model:=Pandar40P
```

## Agnocast

Nebula supports the [Agnocast](https://github.com/tier4/agnocast) zero-copy middleware for
pointcloud and blockage mask outputs.

> **Note**
>
> Agnocast support is currently limited to Hesai sensors.

To build with support for Agnocast, execute the above `colcon build` command with the environment
variable `ENABLE_AGNOCAST=1` set.

The following apt dependencies are required at run time:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:t4-system-software/agnocast
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install agnocast-heaphook-v2.1.2 agnocast-kmod-v2.1.2
```

Nebula binaries that have been compiled with Agnocast support require the following environment
variables to be set at runtime:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/ros/humble/lib/libagnocast_heaphook.so

# This depends on the sensor model used and the number of Nebula topics subscribed.
# A few maximum-size pointclouds worth of memory shall be enough. The below threshold is a
# reasonable default.
export AGNOCAST_MEMPOOL_SIZE=134217728 # 128MB
```

In addition, the Agnocast kernel module must be loaded at runtime:

```bash
sudo modprobe agnocast
```

To confirm that Agnocast support is enabled, run:

```bash
$ ros2 topic list_agnocast
[...]
/pandar_packets
/pandar_points (Agnocast enabled)
[...]
```

Please note that the `packets` topics do not support Agnocast, as they are purely used for
data recording and tools like `ros2 bag` do not have Agnocast support yet.

## Building only specific vendors

By default, building the `nebula` package will build all supported vendors. To build only
specific vendors, use the `--packages-up-to` flag:

```bash
# Build only Hesai support
colcon build --packages-up-to nebula_hesai

# Build multiple vendors
colcon build --packages-up-to nebula_hesai nebula_velodyne
```

Available vendor packages are:

- `nebula_hesai` - Hesai LiDARs (Pandar series, AT128, OT128, etc.)
- `nebula_velodyne` - Velodyne LiDARs (VLP-16, VLP-32, VLS-128)
- `nebula_robosense` - Robosense LiDARs (Bpearl, Helios)
- `nebula_continental` - Continental radars (ARS548, SRR520)

## Migration to Nebula 0.3.0

Version 0.3.0 separates vendor-specific functionality into individual packages. This allows users
to only build the functionality they need.

Since packages have been split and renamed, some changes are required to existing launch files:

- the `nebula_ros` package has been renamed to `nebula`.
- the `nebula_sensor_driver` meta package has been removed. Depend on the `nebula` package, or
  on a `nebula_<vendor>` package instead. `nebula` includes all vendor packages.
- Calibration files have moved from `nebula_decoders` to `nebula_<vendor>_decoders`.
- Vendor-specific launch files have moved from `nebula_ros` to `nebula_<vendor>`.
- `nebula_tests` and `nebula_examples` have been absorbed into the `nebula_<vendor>` packages.

Below are the changes you most likely need to make:

- `ros2 launch nebula_ros nebula_launch.py ...` ➡️ `ros2 launch nebula nebula_launch.py ...`
- `ros2 launch nebula_ros <vendor>_launch_all_hw.xml ...` ➡️ `ros2 launch nebula_<vendor> <vendor>_launch_all_hw.xml ...`
- `$(find-pkg-share nebula_decoders)/calibration/<vendor>/...` ➡️ `$(find-pkg-share nebula_<vendor>_decoders)/calibration/...`
- `$(find-pkg-share nebula_ros)/config/lidar/<vendor>/...` ➡️ `$(find-pkg-share nebula_<vendor>)/config/...`
- `<depend>nebula_ros</depend>` ➡️ `<depend>nebula</depend>` or `<depend>nebula_<vendor></depend>`
- `<depend>nebula_sensor_driver</depend>` ➡️ `<depend>nebula</depend>` or `<depend>nebula_<vendor></depend>`
