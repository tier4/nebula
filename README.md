## Welcome to Nebula, the universal sensor driver

Nebula is a sensor driver platform that is designed to provide a unified framework for as wide a variety of devices as possible.
While it primarily targets Ethernet-based LiDAR sensors, it aims to be easily extendable to support new sensors and interfaces.
Nebula works with ROS 2 and is the recommended sensor driver for the [Autoware](https://autoware.org/) project.

## Documentation

We recommend you get started with the [Nebula Documention](https://tier4.github.io/nebula/).
Here you will find information about the background of the project, how to install and use with ROS 2, and also how to add new sensors to the Nebula driver.

## Quick start

Nebula builds with ROS 2 Galactic and Humble.

> **Note**
>
> Boost version 1.74.0 or later is required. A manual install may be required in Ubuntu versions earlier than 22.04.

To build Nebula run the following commands in your workspace:

```bash
# In workspace
git clone https://github.com/tier4/nebula.git
cd nebula
# Import dependencies
vcs import < build_depends.repos
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -y -r
# Build Nebula
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

To launch Nebula as a ROS 2 node with default parameters for your sensor model:

```bash
ros2 launch nebula_ros *sensor_vendor_name*_launch_all_hw.xml sensor_model:=*sensor_model_name*
```

For example, for a Hesai Pandar40P sensor:

```bash
ros2 launch nebula_ros hesai_launch_all_hw.xml sensor_model:=Pandar40P
```
